They make their own food with the help of the water, solar energy, and carbon dioxide by the method of photosynthesis.</p>
                <p id="conpho" class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">Photosynthesis meaning - Photo means "light" and synthesis means "putting together". Photosynthesis is the process through which plants produce their own food by using carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and clorophyll</p>

They lack chlorophyll or grow in areas with not enough sunlight.Organisms that follow the heterotrophic mode of nutrition are known as heterotrophs. the types of heterotrophic plants are-</p><br><br>

                <p class="content">Organisms that depend on dead and decaying plants and animals for nutrition are called saprophytes.This nutrition is known as saprotrophic nutrition. Organisms like fungi produce enzyms which breaks down plant and animal matter into liquids which can be absorbed by their root-like structures called mycelium.(a vegatative part of fungus). Plants like coralroot and indian pipe absorb nutrients from the mycelium of these fungi.</p>

                <p class="content">Plants that show a symbiotic relationship are called symbiotic plants.Symbiosis is a mutually beneficial relation between 2 or more organisms in which food and shelter are shared by both the organisms.It is a unique relationship between parasite and host. In symbiosis both the organisms coexist and are benefitted without any harm done to either of them. </p>
